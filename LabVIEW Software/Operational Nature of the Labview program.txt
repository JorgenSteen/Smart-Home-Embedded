##The Operation Nature of the LabVIEW Program

#Main Idea of the Structur
The Program starts by initiating essential configuration values for the the program parts.
It then loads those values into the appropriate place. The configuration settings for the Serial communication(Ports etc.) gets loaded into the VI from a file. If this file does not exsist you will be prompted to create one and it is possible to edit it while the program is running. One will need to restart for the new configuration to be loaded, not necessarily the whole program, but most of the time just the program that was configured.

#How to Configure.
There is a configuration SubVI for each the SubVI's that require one. These are all gathered under a common settings SubVI. After you the apprioate configuration SubVI you Save or Discard. Discarding will close configuration SubVI and Save will overwrite the last configuration data, but not close the SubVI. When exiting the SubVI you can choose to either exit and reload VI or just exit. Just exiting will let the program continue and the new settings will be the next time the program starts. Exit and reload will restart the SubVI that is affacted by the configurations and load in the new values.

#Where are the configuration files stored
The files will be stored in Smart Home/Configuration_files.
These files can be edited outside of the program.
